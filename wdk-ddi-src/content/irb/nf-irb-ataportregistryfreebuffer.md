# AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer function



## -description
The <b>AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</b> routine frees the registry buffer that was allocated by using <a href="storage.ataportregistryallocatebuffer">AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</a>.



## -syntax

````
VOID AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer(
  _In_ PVOID ChannelExtension,
  _In_ PVOID Buffer
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the channel extension. 


### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to the buffer to free. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
<b>AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</b> flushes deferred write operations to the registry.

The miniport driver must call <b>AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</b> either in its <a href="storage.atachannelinitroutine">AtaChannelInitRoutine</a> routine or in its <a href="storage.idehwcontrol">IdeHwControl</a> routine. It cannot call <b>AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</b> from any other routine. Additionally, the miniport driver can only call <b>AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</b> from its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine if its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine was called and had a value of either <b>StartChannel</b> or <b>StopChannel</b> in its <i>ControlAction </i>parameter.
