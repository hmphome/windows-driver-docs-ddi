# WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]


   The <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously</b> method 
  prevents an I/O queue from delivering new I/O requests and causes the framework to cancel existing unprocessed requests and driver-owned cancellable requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests.



## -syntax

````
void WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously(
  _In_ WDFQUEUE Queue
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Queue [in]

A handle to a framework queue object.


## -returns
This method does not return a value.


## -remarks
This method returns after all the unprocessed and driver-owned requests (not including requests added to the queue after this call is made) are completed or canceled. If new requests are inserted while <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously</b> is in progress, these new requests are not delivered until driver calls <a href="wdf.wdfioqueuestart">WdfIoQueueStart</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.
